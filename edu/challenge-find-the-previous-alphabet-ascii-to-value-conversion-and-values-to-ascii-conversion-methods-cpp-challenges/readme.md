# Challenge: Find the Previous Alphabet

Test your understanding of the concepts we have covered so far by solving this simple challenge.

## Problem Statement

You are given a character stored in a variable named `character`. Your task is to write code that assigns the previous character in the alphabet to a variable named `character_before`.  
For example, if `character` is `'C'`, your code should set `character_before` to `'B'`.

### Input

The variable `character` is already initialized for you.

Example:

```cpp
character = 'B'
```

### Output

Your code should output the value of `character_before`, which should be the character preceding the one stored in `character`.

Example:

```cpp
character_before = 'A'
```

üìù Please use the variables `character` and `character_before` for input and output, respectively, or your code will not execute.

## Coding Exercise

Before diving directly into the solution, try to solve it yourself. Then, check if your code passes all the test cases. If you get stuck, you can always see the given solution.

Good luck! üëç
