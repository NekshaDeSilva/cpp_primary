# Challenge: Calculate Hours, Minutes, and Seconds

Solve a slightly more tricky challenge in this lesson.

## Problem Statement

You are given the total number of seconds in a variable named `total_seconds`.  
Your task is to calculate and display the number of hours, minutes, and seconds contained in that total.

### Time Conversions

- **1 minute = 60 seconds**
- **1 hour = 60 minutes**

### Input

The variable `total_seconds` is already initialized for you.

Example:
```cpp
int total_seconds = 3870;
```
## Output
Your code should output the following variables:

# 📝 Please use the variables total_seconds for input and hours, minutes, and seconds for output, or your code will not execute.

## Coding Exercise
Before diving directly into the solution, try to solve it yourself.
Then, check if your code passes all the test cases.

Good luck! 👍
